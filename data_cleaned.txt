And all the things you do, 
And it was called "Yellow". 
So then I took my turn,

And I lost my head, 
The thought of all the stupid things I'd said, 
Oh, no, what's this? 
A spider web, and I'm caught in the middle, 
So I turned to run, 
The thought of all the stupid things I've done, 
And I never meant to cause you trouble, 
And I never meant to do you wrong, 
And I, well, if I ever caused you trouble, 
Oh no, I never meant to do you harm.

You don't know how lovely you are 
I had to find you 
Tell you I need you 
Tell you I set you apart 
Tell me your secrets 
And ask me your questions 
Oh, let's go back to the start 
Running in circles 
Coming up tails 
Heads on a science apart 
Nobody said it was easy 
It's such a shame for us to part 
Nobody said it was easy 
No one ever said it would be this hard 
Oh, take me back to the start 
I was just guessing 
At numbers and figures 
Pulling the puzzles apart 
Questions of science 
Science and progress 
Do not speak as loud as my heart 
Tell me you love me 
Come back and haunt me 
Oh, and I rush to the start 
Running in circles 
Chasing our tails 
Coming back as we are 
Nobody said it was easy 
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part 
Nobody said it was easy 
No one ever said it would be so hard 
I'm going back to the start 
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
The lights go out and I can't be saved 
Tides that I tried to swim against 
Have brought me down upon my knees 
Oh I beg, I beg and plead, singing 
Come out of things unsaid 
Shoot an apple off my head and a 
Trouble that can't be named 
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing 
You are 
You are 
Confusion never stops 
Closing walls and ticking clocks  
Gonna come back and take you home 
I could not stop that you now know, singing 
Come out upon my seas 
Cursed missed opportunities  
Am I a part of the cure? 
Or am I part of the disease? Singing 
You are, you are, you are  
You are, you are, you are 
And nothing else compares 
Oh nothing else compares 
And nothing else compares 
You are  
You are 
Home, home where I wanted to go  
Home, home where I wanted to go 
Home, home where I wanted to go 
Home, home where I wanted to go
To my surprise, and my daylight 
I saw sun rise, I saw sunlight 
I am nothing, in the dark 
And the clouds burst to show a daylight  
Oooooo and the sun shines, Yeaaahhh on this star of mine 
Oooooo and I realise, Oooooo couldn't live without 
Oooooo couldn't part without, it 
On a hill top, on a sky rise 
Like a first born, child 
At a full tilt, and at full flight 
You see darkness, in the daylight 
Oooooo and the sun shines, Yeaaahhh on this star of mine 
Oooooo and I realise, Oooooo couldn't be without 
Oooooo couldn't part without, daylight 
Slowly breaking through the daylight  [x22 to fade] 
Honey you are a rock 
Upon which I stand 
And I come here to talk 
I hope you understand 
The green eyes, yeah the spotlight, shines upon you 
And how could, anybody, deny you 
I came here with a load 
And it feels so much lighter now I met you 
And honey you should know 
That I could never go on without you 
Green eyes 
Honey you are the sea 
Upon which I float 
And I came here to talk 
I think you should know 
The green eyes, you're the one that I wanted to find 
And anyone who tried to deny you, must be out of their mind 
Because I came here with a load 
And it feels so much lighter since I met you 
Honey you should know 
That I could never go on without you 
Green eyes, green eyes 
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Honey you are a rock 
Upon which I stand
A warning sign 
I missed the good part, then I realised 
I started looking and the bubble burst 
I started looking for excuses  
Come on in 
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in 
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones 
That I started looking for a warning sign 
When the truth is, I miss you 
Yeah the truth is, that I miss you so 
A warning sign 
It came back to haunt me, and I realised 
That you were an island and I passed you by 
And you were an island to discover 
Come on in 
I've gotta tell you what a state I'm in 
I've gotta tell you in my loudest tones 
That I started looking for a warning sign 
When the truth is, I miss you 
Yeah the truth is, that I miss you so 
And I'm tired, I should not have let you go 
Oooooooo 
So I crawl back into your open arms 
Yes I crawl back into your open arms 
And I crawl back into your open arms 
Yes I crawl back into your open arms.
A whisper
A whisper
A whisper
A whisper
A whisper
A whisper
A whisper
A whisper
I hear the sound of a ticking of clocks 
Remember your face, and remember see where you are gone 
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks 
Come back and look for me, look for me when I am lost 
Just a whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper
Just a whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper
Night turns to day and I still have these questions 
You just won't break, should I go forwards or backwards 
Night turns to day and I've still got no answers 
Just a whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper
Just a whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper
Now I hear the sound of a ticking of clocks 
Remember your face, and remember see where you are gone 
I hear the sound of the ticking of clocks 
Come back and look for me, look for me when I am lost 
Just a whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper
Just a whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper
You said I'm gonna buy this place and burn it down  
I'm gonna put it six feet underground  
You said I'm gonna buy this place and watch it fall 
Stand here beside me baby in the crumbling walls  
Oh I'm gonna buy this place and start a fire 
Stand here until I fill all your hearts desires 
Because I'm gonna buy this place and see it burn 
And do back the things it did to you in return 
Huuuhhhh
Huuuhhhh
Huuuhhhh
Huuuhhhh
You said I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war 
If you can tell me something worth fighting for 
Oh and I'm gonna buy this place is what I said 
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head 
Honey, all the movements you're starting to make 
See me crumble and fall on my face 
And I know the mistakes that I've made 
See it all disappear without trace 
And they call as they beckon you on 
They say start as you need to go on 
Start as you need to go on 
You said I'm gonna buy this place and see it go 
And stand here beside me baby, watch the orange glow 
Some'll laugh and some just sit and cry 
But you just sit down there and you wonder why 
So I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war 
If you can tell me something worth fighting for 
And I'm gonna buy this place is what I said 
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head 
Oh to the head 
Honey, all the movements you're starting to make 
See me crumble and fall on my face 
And I know the mistakes that I've made 
See it all disappear without trace 
And they call as they beckon you on 
They say start as you need to go on 
As you need to go on 
As you need to go on 
So meet me by the bridge 
Oh meet me by the lane 
When am I gonna see that pretty face again 
Oh meet me on the road 
Meet me where I said 
Blame it all upon a rush of blood to the head
Come on, oh my star is fading  
And I swerve out of control 
If I, if I'd only waited 
I'd not be stuck here in this hole  
Come here, oh my star is fading 
And I swerve out of control 
And I swear, I waited and waited 
I've got to get out of this hole 
But time is on your side, its on your side, now 
Not pushing you down, and all around 
It's no cause for concern 
Come on, oh my star is fading 
And I see no chance of release 
And I know I'm dead on the surface 
But I am screaming underneath 
And time is on your side, its on your side, now 
Not pushing you down, and all around 
No it's no cause for concern 
Stuck on the end of this ball and chain 
And I'm on my way back down again 
Stood on the edge, tied to the noose 
Sick to the stomach 
You can say what you mean 
But it won't change a thing 
I'm sick of the secrets 
Stood on the edge, tied to the noose 
And you came along and you cut me loose 
You came along and you cut me loose 
You came along and you cut me loose
You're in control, is there anywhere you wanna go? 
You're in control, is there anything you wanna know? 
The future's for discovering 
The space in which we're travelling 
From the top of the first page 
To the end of the last day 
From the start in your own way 
You just want somebody listening to what you say 
It doesn't matter who you are 
It doesn't matter who you are 
Under the surface trying to break through 
Deciphering the codes in you 
I need a compass, draw me a map 
I'm on the top, I can't get back 
Whoa whoa 
The first line on the first page 
To the end of the last page 
From the start in your own way 
You just want somebody listening to what you say 
It doesn't matter who you are 
It doesn't matter who you are 
You just want 
Somebody listening to what you say 
Oh, you just want somebody listening to what you say 
It doesn't matter who you are 
It doesn't matter who you are 
Is there anybody out there who 
Is lost and hurt and lonely too 
Are they bleeding all your colours into one? 
and if you come undone 
As if you've been run through 
Some catapult it fired you 
You wonder if your chance will ever come 
Or if you're stuck in square one
What if there was no light 
Nothing wrong, nothing right 
What if there was no time 
And no reason, or rhyme 
What if you should decide 
That you don't want me there by your side 
That you don't want me there in your life 
What if I got it wrong 
And no poem or song 
Could put right what I got wrong 
Or make you feel I belong 
What if you should decide 
That you don't want me there by your side 
That you don't want me there in your life 
Ooh ooh-ooh, that's right 
Let's take a breath, jump over the side 
Ooh ooh-ooh, that's right 
How can you know it, if you don't even try 
Ooh ooh-ooh, that's right 
Every step that you take 
Could be your biggest mistake 
It could bend or it could break 
That's the risk that you take 
What if you should decide 
That you don't want me there in your life 
That you don't want me there by your side 
Ooh ooh-ooh, that's right 
Let's take a breath, jump over the side 
Ooh ooh-ooh, that's right 
How can you know when you don't even try 
Ooh ooh-ooh, that's right 
Oh - Ooh ooh-ooh, that's right, 
Let's take a breath, jump over the side. 
Ooh ooh-ooh, that's right, 
You know that darkness always turns into light. 
Ooh-ooh, that's right
When I was a young boy I tried to listen 
And I want to feel like that 
Little white shadows blink and miss them 
Part of a system, I am 
If you ever feel like 
Something's missing 
Things you never understand 
Little white shadows sparkle and glisten 
Part of a system a plan 
All this noise I'm waking up 
All the space I'm taking up 
All this sound is breaking up 
Maybe you'll get what you wanted 
Maybe you'll stumble upon it 
Everything you ever wanted in a permanent state 
Maybe you'll know when you've seen it 
Maybe if you say it you'll mean it 
And when you find it you'll keep it 
In a permanent state 
A permanent state 
When I was a young boy I tried to listen 
Don't you want to feel like that? 
You're part of the human race 
All of the stars and the outer space 
Part of a system a plan 
All this noise I'm waking up 
All the space I'm taking up 
I cannot hear, you're breaking up 
Maybe you'll get what you wanted 
Maybe you'll stumble upon it 
Everything you ever wanted in a permanent state 
Maybe you'll know when you've seen it 
Maybe if you say it you'll mean it 
And when you find it you'll keep it 
In a permanent state 
A permanent state 
Swim out on a sea of faces 
The tide of the human races 
An answer now is what I need 
See it in the new sun rise and 
See it break on your horizon 
Oh come on love 
Stay with me
When you try your best, but you don't succeed 
When you get what you want, but not what you need 
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep 
Stuck in reverse 
And the tears come streaming down your face 
When you lose something you can't replace 
When you love someone, but it goes to waste 
Could it be worse? 
Lights will guide you home 
And ignite your bones 
And I will try to fix you 
And high up above or down below 
When you're too in love to let it go 
But if you never try you'll never know 
Just what you're worth 
Lights will guide you home 
And ignite your bones 
And I will try to fix you 
Tears stream down your face 
When you lose something you cannot replace 
Tears stream down your face and I 
Tears stream down your face 
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes 
Tears stream down your face and I 
Lights will guide you home 
And ignite your bones 
And I will try to fix you
Oh brother I can't, I can't get through 
I've been trying hard to reach you, cause I don't know what to do 
Oh brother I can't believe it's true 
I'm so scared about the future and I wanna talk to you 
Oh I wanna talk to you 
You can take a picture of something you see 
In the future where will I be? 
You can climb a ladder up to the sun 
Or write a song nobody has sung 
Or do something that's never been done 
Are you lost or incomplete? 
Do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece? 
Tell me how do you feel? 
Well, I feel like they're talking in a language I don't speak 
And they're talking it to me 
So you take a picture of something you see 
In the future where will I be? 
You can climb a ladder up to the sun 
Or write a song nobody has sung 
Or do something that's never been done 
Do something that's never been done 
So you don't know where you're going, and you wanna talk 
And you feel like you're going where you've been before 
You tell anyone who'll listen but you feel ignored 
Nothing's really making any sense at all 
Let's talk, let's ta-a-alk 
Let's talk, let's ta-a-alk
Trying hard to speak and 
Fighting with my weak hand 
Driven to distraction 
So part of the plan 
When something is broken 
And you try to fix it 
Trying to repair it 
Any way you can 
I'm diving off the deep end 
You become my best friend 
I wanna love you 
But I don't know if I can 
I know something is broken 
And I'm trying to fix it 
Trying to repair it 
Any way I can 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh... 
You and me are floating on a tidal wave... 
Together 
You and me are drifting into outer space... 
And singing 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh... 
You and me are floating on a tidal wave... 
Together 
You and me are drifting into outer space 
You and me are floating on a tidal wave... 
Together 
You and me are drifting into outer space... 
And singing 
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh...
How long before I get in? 
Before it starts, before I begin? 
How long before you decide? 
Before I know what it feels like? 
Where To, where do I go? 
If you never try, then you'll never know. 
How long do I have to climb, 
Up on the side of this mountain of mine? 
Look up, I look up at night, 
Planets are moving at the speed of light. 
Climb up, up in the trees, 
every chance that you get, 
is a chance you seize. 
How long am I gonna stand, 
with my head stuck under the sand? 
I'll start before I can stop, 
before I see things the right way up. 
All that noise, and all that sound, 
All those places I got found. 
And birds go flying at the speed of sound, 
to show you how it all began. 
Birds came flying from the underground, 
if you could see it then you'd understand? 
Ideas that you'll never find, 
All the inventors could never design. 
The buildings that you put up, 
Japan and China all lit up. 
The sign that I couldn't read, 
or a light that I couldn't see, 
some things you have to believe, 
but others are puzzles, puzzling me. 
All that noise, and all that sound, 
All those places I got found. 
And birds go flying at the speed of sound, 
to show you how it all began. 
Birds came flying from the underground, 
if you could see it then you'd understand, 
ah when you see it then you'll understand? 
All those signs, I knew what they meant. 
Some things you can invent. 
Some get made, and some get sent, 
Ooh? 
Birds go flying at the speed of sound, 
to show you how it all began. 
Birds came flying from the underground, 
if you could see it then you'd understand, 
ah, when you see it then you'll understand?
My song is love 
Love to the loveless shown 
And it goes on 
You don't have to be alone 
Your heavy heart 
Is made of stone 
And it's so hard to see you clearly 
You don't have to be on your own 
You don't have to be on your own 
And I'm not gonna take it back 
And I'm not gonna say, "I don't mean that" 
You're the target that I'm aiming at 
Got to get that message home 
My song is love 
My song is love, unknown 
But I'm on fire for you, clearly 
You don't have to be alone 
You don't have to be on your own 
And I'm not gonna take it back 
And I'm not gonna say, "I don't mean that" 
You're the target that I'm aiming at 
And I'm nothing on my own 
Got to get that message home 
And I'm not gonna stand and wait 
Not gonna leave it until it's much too late 
On a platform I'm gonna stand and say 
That I'm nothing on my own 
And I love you, please come home 
My song is love, is love unknown 
And I've got to get that message home
You see the world in black and white 
No colour or light 
You think you'll never get it right 
But you're wrong. You might. 
The sky could fall, could fall on me 
The parting of the sea 
But you mean more, mean more to me 
Than any colour I can see 
All you ever wanted was love, 
But you never looked hard enough, 
It's never gonna give itself up 
All you ever wanted to be 
Living in perfect symmetry, 
Nothing is as down or as up as us 
You see the world in black and white 
Not painted right 
You see no meaning to your life 
You should try 
You should try 
All you ever wanted was love, 
But you never looked hard enough, 
It's never gonna give itself up 
All you ever wanted to be, 
Living in perfect symmetry, 
Nothing is as down or as up 
Don't you want to see it come soon, 
Floating in a big white balloon 
Come give her your own silver spoon 
Don't you want to see it come down? 
There for throwing your arms around 
And say "You're not a moment too soon." 
Cause I feel low, cause I feel low 
ooooh... 
Yeah I feel low 
oh no...oooh 
Cause I feel low, cause I feel low 
oh... 
Yet I feel low 
oh no...oooh
And the hardest part 
Was letting go, not taking part 
Was the hardest part 
And the strangest thing 
Was waiting for that bell to ring 
It was the strangest start 
I could feel it go down 
Bittersweet, I could taste in my mouth 
Silver lining the cloud 
Oh and I 
I wish that I could work it out 
And the hardest part 
Was letting go, not taking part 
You really broke my heart 
And I tried to sing 
But I couldn’t think of anything 
And that was the hardest part 
I could feel it go down 
You left the sweetest taste in my mouth 
You're a silver lining the clouds 
Oh and I 
Oh and I 
I wonder what it’s all about 
I wonder what it’s all about 
Everything I know is wrong 
Everything I do, it's just comes undone 
And everything is torn apart 
Oh and it’s the hardest part 
That’s the hardest part 
Yeah that’s the hardest part 
That’s the hardest part
You cut me down a tree 
And brought it back to me 
And that's what made me see 
Where I was going wrong 
You put me on a shelf 
And kept me for yourself 
I can only blame myself 
You can only blame me 
And I could write a song 
A hundred miles long 
Well, that's where I belong 
And you belong with me 
And I could write it down 
Or spread it all around 
Get lost and then get found 
Or swallowed in the sea 
You put me on a line 
And hung me out to dry 
And darling that's when I 
Decided to go to see you 
You cut me down to size 
And opened up my eyes 
Made me realize 
What I could not see 
And I could write a book 
The one they'll say that shook 
The world, and then it took 
It took it back from me 
And I could write it down 
Or spread it all around 
Get lost and then get found 
And you'll come back to me 
Not swallowed in the sea 
Ooh... 
And I could write a song 
A hundred miles long 
Well, that's where I belong 
And you belong with me 
The streets you're walking on 
A thousand houses long 
Well, that's where I belong 
And you belong with me 
Oh what good is it to live 
With nothing left to give 
Forget but not forgive 
Not loving all you see 
Oh the streets you're walking on 
A thousand houses long 
Well that's where I belong 
And you belong with me 
Not swallowed in the sea 
You belong with me 
Not swallowed in the sea 
Yeah, you belong with me 
Not swallowed in the sea
Sunlight, opened up my eyes 
To see for the first time 
You'll open them up 
And tonight, rivers will run dry 
And not for the first time 
Rivers will run 
Hundreds of years in the future 
It could be computers 
Looking for life on earth 
Don't fight for the wrong side 
Say what you feel like 
Say how you feel 
You'll go backwards, but then 
You'll go forwards again 
You'll go backwards, but then 
You'll go 
Created, then drilled and invaded 
If somebody made it 
Someone will mess it up 
And you are not wrong to 
Ask who does this belong to 
It belongs to all of us 
You'll go backwards, but then 
You'll go forwards again 
You'll go backwards, but then 
you'll go forwards 
You'll go backwards, but then 
you'll go forwards again 
You'll go forwards again 
You'll go forwards
Steal my heart and hold my tongue. 
I feel my time, my time has come. 
Let me in, unlock the door. 
I've never felt this way before. 
The wheels just keep on turning, 
The drummer begins to drum, 
I don't know which way I'm going, 
I don't know which way I've come. 
Hold my head inside your hands, 
I need someone who understands. 
I need someone, someone who hears, 
For you, I've waited all these years. 
For you, I'd wait 'til kingdom come. 
Until my day, my day is done. 
And say you'll come, and set me free, 
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me. 
In your tears and in your blood, 
In your fire and in your flood, 
I hear you laugh, I heard you sing, 
"I wouldn't change a single thing." 
The wheels just keep on turning, 
The drummers begin to drum, 
I don't know which way I'm going, 
I don't know what I've become. 
For you, I'd wait 'til kingdom come, 
Until my days, my days are done. 
Say you'll come and set me free, 
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me. 
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me. 
Just say you'll wait, you'll wait for me.
Are you running in a circle? 
You can't be too careful 
And you can't relate it 
'Cause it's complicated 
Oh you're gonna get it right some time 
You're gonna get it right some time 
It's how you see the world 
How many times can you see? 
You can't believe what you learn 
It's how you see the world 
Don't you worry yourself 
Your not gonna get hurt 
Oooohhhhh... 
Is there something missing? 
There's nobody listening 
Are you scared of what you don't know? 
Don't wanna end up on your own? 
You need conversation 
And information 
Ohhhhhhhhh... 
Gonna get it right sometimes 
You just wanna get it right sometimes 
It's how you see the world 
How many times have you heard? 
You can't believe a word 
It's how you see the world 
Don't you worry yourself 
'Cause nobody can learn 
Oooooh 
Oooooh 
Ooooooooh 
That's how you see the world 
That's how you see the world
At night they would go walking ‘til the breaking of the day,  
The morning is for sleeping…  
Through the dark streets they go searching to seek God in their own way,  
Save the nighttime for your weeping…  
Your weeping…  
Singing la lalalala la le…  
And the night over London rang.  
So we rode down to the river where the toiling ghosts strain  
for their curses to be broken…  
We’d go underneath the arches where the witches are in there saying  
There are ghost towns in the ocean…  
The ocean…  
Singing la lalalala la le…  
And the night over London rang.  
God is in the houses and God is in my head… and all the cemeteries in London…  
I see God come in my garden, but I don’t know what he said,  
For my heart, it wasn’t open…  
Not open…  
Singing la lalalala la le…  
and the night over London rang.  
Singing la lalalala la le…  
There's no light over London today.
Just because I'm losing 
Doesn't mean I'm lost 
Doesn't mean I'll stop 
Doesn't mean I would cross 
Just because I'm hurting 
Doesn't mean I'm hurt 
Doesn't mean I didn't get 
What I deserved 
No better and no worse 
I just got lost 
Every river that I tried to cross 
Every door I ever tried was locked 
Ohhh and I'm... 
Just waiting 'til the shine wears off 
You might be a big fish 
In a little pond 
Doesn't mean you've won 
'Cause along may come 
A bigger one 
And you'll be lost 
Every river that you tried to cross 
Every gun you ever held went off 
Ohhh and I'm... 
Just waiting 'til the firing stopped 
Ohhh and I'm... 
Just waiting 'til the shine wears off 
Ohhh and I'm... 
Just waiting 'til the shine wears off 
Ohhh and I'm... 
Just waiting 'til the shine wears off
Those who are dead are not dead  
They’re just living in my head  
And since I fell for that spell  
I am living there as well  
Oh..  
Time is so short and I’m sure  
There must be something more  
Those who are dead are not dead  
They’re just living in my head oh…  
And since I fell for that spell  
I am living there as well oh…  
Time is so short and I’m sure  
There must be something more  
You thought you might be a ghost  
You thought you might be a ghost  
You didn’t get to heaven but you made it close  
You didn’t get to heaven but you made it close  
You thought you might be a ghost  
You thought you might be a ghost  
You didn’t get to heaven but you made it close  
You didn’t get to heaven but you oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh  
Oh oh…  
Those who are dead are not dead  
They’re just living in my head  
Oh..
Lovers, keep on the road you're on  
Runners, until the race is run  
Soldiers, you've got to soldier on  
Sometimes even right is wrong  
They are turning my head out  
To see what I'm all about  
Keeping my head down  
To see what it feels like now  
But I have no doubt  
One day, we are gonna get out  
Tonight maybe we're gonna run  
Dreaming of the Osaka sun  
Ohh ohh...  
Dreaming of when the morning comes  
They are turning my head out  
To see what I'm all about  
Keeping my head down  
To see what it feels like now  
But I have no doubt  
One day the sun will come out  
... 
Reign of love  
I can’t let go  
To the sea I offer  
This heavy load  
Locusts will  
Lift me up  
I’m just a prisoner  
In a reign of love  
Locusts will  
Let us stop  
I wish I’d spoken  
To the reign of love  
Reign of love  
By the church, we’re waiting  
Reign of love  
My knees go praying  
How I wish  
I’d spoken up  
Or we’d be carried  
In the reign of love.
When it started we had high hopes  
Now my back's on the line  
My back's on the ropes  
When it started we were alright  
But night makes a fool  
of us in the daylight  
Then we were dying of frustration  
Saying Lord lead me not into temptation  
But it’s not easy when she turns you on  
Sin, stay gone  
If you’d only, if you’d only say yes  
Whether you will's anybody’s guess  
God only God knows I'm trying my best  
But I’m just so tired of this loneliness  
Hey  
So up they picked me by the big toe  
I was held from the rooftop then they let go  
Dizzily screaming 'Let the windows down'  
As I crawl to the ground  
If you'd only if you'd only say yes  
Whether you will's anybody's guess  
God only God knows she won't let me rest  
But I'm just so tired of this loneliness  
I've become so tired of this loneliness
Fall asleep

I used to rule the world 
Seas would rise when I gave the word 
Now in the morning I sleep alone 
Sweep the streets I used to own 
I used to roll the dice 
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes 
Listened as the crowd would sing 
Now the old king is dead long live the king 
One minute I held the key 
Next the walls were closed on me 
And I discovered that my castles stand 
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand 
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing 
Roman cavalry choirs are singing 
Be my mirror, my sword and shield 
My missionaries in a foreign field 
For some reason I can't explain 
Once you'd gone there was never 
Never an honest word 
And that was when I ruled the world 
It was a wicked and wild wind 
Blew down the doors to let me in 
Shattered windows and the sound of drums 
People couldn't believe what I'd become 
Revolutionaries wait 
For my head on a silver plate 
Just a puppet on a lonely string 
Oh who would ever want to be king? 
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing 
Roman cavalry choirs are singing 
Be my mirror, my sword and shield 
My missionaries in a foreign field 
For some reason I can't explain 
I know St Peter won't call my name 
Never an honest word 
But that was when I ruled the world 
Oh oh oh oh ohh oh
Oh oh oh oh ohh oh
Oh oh oh oh ohh oh
Oh oh oh oh ohh oh
Oh oh oh oh ohh oh
Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing 
Roman cavalry choirs are singing 
Be my mirror, my sword and shield 
My missionaries in a foreign field 
For some reason I can't explain 
I know St Peter won't call my name 
Never an honest word 
But that was when I ruled the world
It was a long and dark December 
From the rooftops I remember 
There was snow, white snow 
Clearly I remember 
From the windows they were watching 
While we froze down below 
When the future's architectured 
By a carnival of idiots on show 
You'd better lie low 
If you love me, won't you let me know? 
Was a long and dark December 
When the banks became cathedrals 
And a fox became God 
Priests clutched onto Bibles 
Hollowed out to fit their rifles 
And a cross was held aloft 
Bury me in armour 
When I'm dead and hit the ground 
My nerves are poles that unfroze 
And if you love me, won't you let me know? 
I don't want to be a soldier 
Who the captain of some sinking ship 
Would stow, far below. 
So if you love me, why d'you let me go? 
I took my love down to violet hill 
There we sat in snow 
All that time she was silent still 
Said if you love me, won't you let me know? 
If you love me, won't you let me know?
They were sitting  
They were sitting on the strawberry swing  
Every moment was so precious  
They were sitting  
They were talking under strawberry swing  
Everybody was for fighting  
Wouldn't wanna waste a thing  
Cold, cold water bring me round  
Now my feet won't touch the ground  
Cold, cold water what ya say?  
When it's such…  
It's such a perfect day  
It's such a perfect day  
I remember  
We were walking up to strawberry swing  
I can't wait until the morning  
Wouldn't wanna change a thing  
People moving all the time  
Inside a perfectly straight line  
Don't you wanna curve away?  
When it's such…  
It's such a perfect day  
It's such a perfect day  
Now the sky could be blue  
I don't mind  
Without you it's a waste of time  
Could be blue  
I don’t mind  
Without you it’s a waste of time  
Could be blue,  
Could be grey  
Without you I’m just miles away  
Could be blue  
I don’t mind  
Without you it’s a waste of time
All winter we got carried 
Oh way over on the rooftops let's get married. 
All summer we just hurried 
So come over, just be patient, and don't worry. 
So come over, just be patient, and don't worry. 
So come over, just be patient, and don't worry. 
And don't worry. 
No, I don't wanna battle from beginning to end; 
I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge; 
I don't want to follow death and all of his friends. 
No, I don't wanna battle from beginning to end; 
I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge; 
I don't want to follow death and all of his friends. 
And in the end, we lie awake 
And we dream of making escape. 
And in the end, we lie awake 
And we dream of making escape.
And in the end 
We lie awake 
And we dream 
Of making our escape 
And in the end 
We lie awake 
And we dream 
Of making our escape 
Ooh...
There's a wild wind blowing, 
Down the corner of my street 
Every night there the headlights are glowing 
Theres a cold war coming,  
On the radio I heard 
Baby it's a violent world 
Oh love don't let me go 
Won't you take me where the streetlights glow 
I could hear it coming 
I could hear the sirens sound 
Now my feet won't touch the ground 
Time came a-creepin' 
Oh and time's a loaded gun 
Every road is a ray of light 
It goes o-o-on 
Time only can lead you on 
Still it's such a beautiful night 
Oh love don't let me go 
Won't you take me where the streetlights glow 
I could hear it coming 
Like a serenade of sound 
Now my feet won't touch the ground 
Gravity release me, 
And dont ever hold me down 
Now my feet won't touch the ground.
Scared of losing all the time 
He wrote it in a letter 
He was a friend of mine 
He heard you could see your future 
Inside a glass of water 
The ripples and the rhymes 
He asked Will I see heaven in mine? 
That is just the way it was 
Nothing could be better 
And nothing ever was 
Oh they say you could see your future, 
Inside a glass of water 
With riddles and the rhymes 
Will I see heaven in mine? 
Oh Oh Oh 
Ah Son, dont ask, 
Neither how full nor empty 
is your glass 
Cling to the mast 
Spend your whole life living in the past 
Going nowhere fast 
So he wrote it on the wall 
The hollowest of halos 
Is no halo at all 
Televisions said and past 
In figurines and leaders 
saying nothing at all 
And he chimed stars in heaven aligned 
Oh Oh Oh 
Ah Son, dont ask, 
Neither how full nor empty is your glass 
Cling to the mast 
Spend your whole life living in the past 
Going nowhere fast 
What are we drinking when were done? 
Glasses of water...
Then there was rain 
The sky wore a veil of gold and green 
Night is the bride of a lonely day 
Time just floated 
Then there was rain 
The sound foundations are crumbling 
To the ground comes a pyramid tumbling 
Time just floated away 
We can watch it and stay 
And we can listen 
Oh rainy day come around 
Sometimes I just want it to slow down 
And we're separated now 
And oh but I love when you come over to the house 
I love it when you come over to my house 
Then there was rain 
I spent the night with the queen of Spain 
My lonely little heart well it broke again 
Time so vicious 
The deeper that the knife goes in 
The more you win 
You end up with less than where you begin 
The deeper that the knife goes in 
Oh rainy day come round 
Sometimes I just want it to slow down 
We're separated now 
And oh but I love it when you come over to the house 
I love it when you come over to my house 
And I love it when you come over to the house 
I love it when you come over to my house 
I love it when you come over to the house 
I love it when you come over to my house
Smoke is rising from the houses 
People burying their dead 
I ask somebody what the time is 
But time doesn't matter to them yet 
People talking without speaking 
Trying to take what they can get 
I ask you if you remember 
Prospekt, how could I forget? 
Drums, here it comes 
Don't you wish that life can be as simple 
As fish swimming round in a barrel? 
When you've got the gun 
Oh when I run, here it comes 
We're just two little figures in a soup bowl 
Trying to get to any kind of control 
But I wasn't one 
Now here I lie on my own in a separate sky 
Here I lie on my own in a separate sky 
I don't wanna die on my own here tonight 
But here I lie on my own in a separate sky
Just because I'm losing 
Doesn't mean I'm lost 
Doesn't mean I'll stop 
Doesn't mean I'm across 
Just because I'm hurting 
Doesn't mean I'm hurt 
Doesn't mean I didn't get what I deserved 
No better and no worse 
I just got lost! 
Every river that I tried to cross 
Every door I ever tried was locked 
Oh and I'm just waiting til the shine wears off 
You might be a big fish 
In a little pond 
Doesn't mean you've won 
'Cause along may come 
A bigger one 
And you'll be lost! 
Every river that you tried to cross 
Every gun you ever held went off 
Oh and I'm just waiting til the firing's stopped 
Oh and I'm just waiting til the shine wears off 
Yeah 
...just waitin' til the... the... yeah 
Aha, I gotcha, uh... 
With the same sword they knight you, they gon' good night you with 
Shit, that's only half if they like you 
That ain't even the half what they might do 
Don't believe me, ask Michael 
See Martin, see Malcolm 
See Biggie, see Pac, see success and its outcome 
See Jesus, see Judas 
See Caesar, see Brutus, see success is like suicide 
Suicide, it's a suicide 
If you succeed, prepare to be crucified 
Media meddles, niggas sue you, you settle 
Every step you take, they remind you you're ghetto 
So it's tough being Bobby Brown 
To be Bobby then, you have to be Bobby now 
And the question is, "Is to have had and lost 
Better than not having at all?" 
Because I'm... 
Oh and I'm just waiting til the shine wears off 
Oh and I'm just waiting til the shine wears off
Let me go boys let me go 
Push my boat from the highest cliff to the sea below 
Rocks are waiting boys rocks await 
Swoop down from the sky and catch me like a bird of prey 
Now my feet won't touch the ground 
Now my head won't stop 
You wait a lifetime to be found 
Now my feet won't touch the ground 
Singing now my feet won't touch the ground 
Now my head won't stop 
You wait a lifetime to be found 
Now my feet won't touch the ground 
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Written in graffiti on a bridge in a park 
'Do you ever get the feeling that you're missing the mark?' 
It's so cold, it's so cold 
It's so cold, it's so cold 
Written up in marker on a factory sign 
'I struggle with the feeling that my life isn't mine' 
It's so cold, it's so cold 
It's so cold, it's so cold 
See the arrow that they shot, trying to tear us apart 
Take the fire from my belly and the beat from my heart 
Still I won't let go 
Still I won't let go 
You 
Ooohooh 
'Cause you do 
Oh you use your heart as a weapon 
And it hurts like heaven 
On every street every car every surface a name 
Tonight the streets are ours 
And we’re writing and saying 
Don't let them take control 
No we won't let them take control 
Yes, I feel a little bit nervous, 
Yes, I feel nervous and I cannot relax, 
How come they're out to get us? 
How come they're out when they don't know the facts? 
So on concrete canvas under cover of dark 
On concrete canvas, I'll go making my mark 
Armed with a spray can soul 
I'll be armed with a spray can soul 
You 
Ooohooh 
Oh, you 
Ooohooh 
Yes, you 
You use your heart as a weapon 
And it hurts like heaven 
Woho-ooh 
Woho-oooh 
It's true 
When you 
Use your heart as a weapon 
It hurts like heaven
When she was just a girl 
She expected the world 
But it flew away from her reach so 
She ran away in her sleep 
And dreamed of 
Para-para-paradise, Para-para-paradise, Para-para-paradise 
Every time she closed her eyes 
When she was just a girl 
She expected the world 
But it flew away from her reach 
And the bullets catch in her teeth 
Life goes on, it gets so heavy 
The wheel breaks the butterfly 
Every tear a waterfall 
In the night the stormy night she'll close her eyes 
In the night the stormy night away she'd fly 
And dreams of 
Para-para-paradise 
Para-para-paradise 
Para-para-paradise 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh 
She'd dream of 
Para-para-paradise 
Para-para-paradise 
Para-para-paradise 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh-oh 
Lalalalalalalalalalala 
And so lying underneath those stormy skies 
She'd say, "oh, ohohohoh I know the sun must set to rise" 
This could be 
Para-para-paradise 
Para-para-paradise 
Para-para-paradise 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh 
This could be 
Para-para-paradise 
Para-para-paradise 
Para-para-paradise 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh 
This could be 
Para-para-paradise 
Para-para-paradise 
Para-para-paradise 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh
Wooh, ooh ooh ooh 
Stole a key, 
Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet, 
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me 
To set me free, 
I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene, 
Saw the lights go down and standing in front of me. 
Wooh, ooh ooh ooh 
In my scarecrow dreams, 
When they smash my heart into smithereens, 
Be a bright red rose come bursting the concrete. 
Be a cartoon heart, 
Light a fire, a fire, a spark 
Light a fire, a flame in my heart. 
We'll run wild, 
We'll be glowing in the dark. 
Wooh, ooh ooh ooh 
We'll be glowing in the dark. 
All the boys, all the girls, 
All that matters in the world 
All the boys, all the girls, 
All the madness that occurs. 
All the highs, all the lows, 
As the room a-spinning goes 
We'll run riot, 
We'll be glowing in the dark. 
Wooh, ooh ooh ooh 
So we'll soar luminous and wired 
We'll be glowing in the dark.
Oh morning come bursting the clouds, amen 
Lift off this blindfold, let me see again 
And bring back the water, let your ships roll in 
In my heart she left a hole 
The tightrope that I'm walking just sways and ties 
The devil, as he's talking, with those angel's eyes 
And I just want to be there when the lightning strikes 
And the saints go marching in 
And sing slow it down 
Through chaos as it swirls 
It's us against the world 
Like a river to a raindrop 
I lost a friend 
My drunken hazard Daniel in a lion's den 
And tonight I know it all has to begin again 
So whatever you do 
Don't let go 
And if we could float away 
Fly up to the surface and just start again 
And lift off before trouble just erodes us in the rain 
Just erodes us in the rain 
Just erodes us and see roses in the rain 
And sing slow it down 
Slow it down 
Through chaos as it swirls 
It's us against the world 
Through chaos as it swirls 
It's us against the world
I turn the music up, I got my records on 
I shut the world outside until the lights come on 
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone 
I feel my heart stop beating to my favorite song 
And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night 
Until Monday morning feels another life 
I turn the music up 
I'm on a roll this time 
And heaven is in sight 
I turn the music up, I got my records on 
From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song 
Don't want to see another generation drop 
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop 
Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees 
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes 
But my heart is beating and my pulses start 
Cathedrals in my heart 
As we saw oh this light I swear you'll, 
Emerge blinking into to tell me it's alright 
As we soar walls, every siren is a symphony 
And every tear's a waterfall 
Is a waterfall 
Ah 
Is a waterfall 
Ah ah ah 
Is a is a waterfall 
Every tear 
Is a waterfall 
Ah ah ah 
So you can hurt, hurt me bad 
But still I'll raise the flag 
It was a wa wa wa wa wa-terfall 
A wa wa wa wa wa-terfall 
Every tear 
Every tear 
Every teardrop is a waterfall 
Every tear 
Every tear 
Every teardrop is a waterfall 
Every tear 
Every tear 
Every teardrop is a waterfall 
Every tear 
Every tear 
Every teardrop is a waterfall 
Every tear 
Every tear 
Every teardrop is a waterfall
They got one eye watching you 
One eye, what you do? 
So be careful who it is you’re talking to 
They got one eye watching you 
One eye, what you do? 
So be careful what it is you’re tryin’ to do 
And be careful when you’re walking into view 
Just be careful when you’re walking into view 
Ooh-ooh-oooh 
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh 
Got one eye on the road and one on you 
Ooh-ooh-oooh 
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh 
Got one eye on the road and one on… 
They got one eye watching you 
And one eye, what you do? 
So be careful 'cause nothing they say is true 
Bu-but don’t believe a word 
It’s just us against the world 
And we just gotta turn to be heard 
I hear the crocodiles ticking ’round the world 
I hear those crocodiles ticking, they go ticking ’round the world 
Ooh-ooh-oooh 
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh 
Got one eye on the road and one on you 
Ooh-ooh-oooh 
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh 
Got one eye on the road and hey! 
I can hear them climbing the stairs 
I got my left side, fight you on my left 
Hiding under the chairs 
Ooh-ooh-oooh 
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh 
Got one eye on the road and one on you 
Ooh-ooh-oooh 
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh 
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Lord I don't know which way I am going 
Which way the river gonna flow 
It's just seems that upstream, I keep rowing 
Still got such a long way to go 
Still got such a long way to go 
Then that light, it's your eye 
I know, I swear, 
We'll find somewhere the streets are paved with gold 
Bullets fly, split the sky 
But that's all right, sometimes, sunlight comes streaming through the holes 
Oooohhh ooooohh...
Ohhhhh... 
Once upon a time somebody ran 
Somebody ran away saying fast as I can 
I've got to go, I've got to go!!! 
Once upon a time we fell apart 
You're holding in your hands the two halves of my heart 
Ohhhhh, ohhhhh! 
Ohhhhh... 
Once upon a time, we burned bright 
Now all we ever seem to do is fight 
On and on... 
And on and on and on... 
Once upon a time on the same side. 
Once upon a time on the same side, in the same game 
And why'd you have to go, have to go and throw water on my flame 
I could've been a princess, you'd be a king 
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring 
But no, you let me go 
I could've been a princess, you'd be a king 
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring 
But no, you let me go 
And stole my star 
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
You stole my star 
La, la la la la laaaaaa 
Oooooooh-oh oh oooooooh oh oh oh ohhhhhhhhh 
Oooooooh-oh oh oooooooh oh oh oh ohhhhhhhhh 
Cause you really hurt me 
No you really hurt me 
Cause you really hurt me 
No you really hurt me 
Cause you really hurt me 
Ooooooooh you really hurt me, ooooooooh 
Cause you really hurt me 
Ooooooooh you really hurt me...
So it's over 
This time, I know, it's gone 
Salt water 
You tasted it too long 
I only know one role 
Now I know it's gone 
Up in flames 
Up in flames 
Up in flames 
We have slowly gone 
So it's over 
This time, you're flyin' home 
This time, I know no song 
Can't stop it slowly go 
Can't stop it slowly go 
Up in flames 
Up in flames 
Up in flames 
We have slowly gone 
Up in flames 
Up in flames 
Up in flames 
We have slowly gone 
Oh, we have slowly gone 
Could we pour some water on?
And if I lost the map 
If I lost it all 
Or fell into the trap 
Then she'd call 
When you're tired of racing and you 
Found you never left the start 
Come on baby, don’t let it break your heart 
Though heavily we bled 
Still on we crawl 
Try to catch a cannonball. 
And a slowly burning tide (oh) 
Through my veins is flowing. 
From my shipwreck I heard her call 
And she sang 
When you're tired of aiming your arrows, 
Still you never hit the mark 
And even if your aims are shadows 
Still we're never gonna part 
Come on baby don't let it break your heart 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Don’t let it break your heart 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
Don’t let it break your heart 
Don’t let it break your heart’
The birds they sang, at break of day. 
"Start again", I hear them say. 
It's so hard to just walk away. 
The birds they sang, all a choir, 
"Start again a little higher". 
It's a spark in a sea of gray. 
The sky is blue, 
Dreamed that lie 'til it's true, 
Then takin' back the punch I threw, 
My arms turn wings, 
Oh, those clumsy things 
Send me up to that wonderful world 
And then I'm up with the birds. 
Might have to go where they don't know my name 
Float all over the world just to see her again 
And I won't show or fear any pain, 
Even though all my armor might rust in the rain 
A simple plot but I know one day 
Good things are coming our way 
A simple plot but I know one day 
Good things are coming our way, 
Oh, yeah...
I think of you 
I haven't slept 
I think I do 
But, I don't forget 
My body moves 
Goes where I will 
But though I try my heart stays still 
It never moves 
Just won't be led 
And so my mouth waters, to be fed 
And you're always in my head 
You're always in my head 
You're always in my head 
You're always in my head 
You're always in my head 
Always in my... 
Always in my... 
This, I guess, is to tell you you're chosen out from the rest...
Call it magic 
Call it true 
Call it magic 
When I'm with you 
And I just got broken 
Broken into two 
Still I call it magic 
When I'm next to you 
And I don't, and I don't and I don't, and I don't 
No, I don't, 
It's true 
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't want anybody else but you 
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't 
No, I don't, 
It's true 
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't want anybody else but you 
Ooooh ooh ooh 
Call it magic 
Cut me into two 
And with all your magic 
I disappear from view 
And I can't get over 
Can't get over you 
Still I call it magic 
You're such a precious jewel 
And I don't, and I don't and I don't, and I don't 
No, I don't, 
It's true 
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't want anybody else but you 
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't 
No, I don't, 
It's true 
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't want anybody else but you 
Wanna fall 
I fall so far 
I wanna fall 
I fall so hard 
And I call it magic 
And I call it true 
I call it magic 
Ooooh ooh ooh 
Ooooh ooh ooh 
Ooooh ooh ooh 
Ooooh ooh ooh 
And if you were to ask me 
After all that we've been through 
Still believe in magic 
Oh yes I do 
Oh yes I do 
Yes I do 
Oh yes I do 
Of course I do
Got a tattoo said 'together thru life' 
Carved in your name with my pocket knife 
And you wonder when you wake up will it be alright 
Feels like there's something broken inside 
All I know 
All I know 
Is that I'm lost 
Whenever you go 
All I know 
Is that I love you so 
So much that it hurts 
Got a tattoo and the pain's alright 
Just want a way of keeping you inside 
All I know 
All I know 
Is that I'm lost 
In your fire below 
All I know 
Is that I love you so 
So much that it hurts 
I see the road begin to climb 
I see your stars begin to shine 
I see your colours and I'm dying of thirst 
All I know 
Is that I love you so 
So much that it hurts 
Oh yeah yeah yeah 
So much that it hurts 
So much that it hurts
For a second, I was in control 
I had it once, I lost it though 
And all along the fire below would rise 
And I wish you could have let me know 
What's really going on below 
I've lost you now, you let me go 
But one last time 
Tell me you love me 
If you don't then lie 
Lie to me 
Remember once upon a time 
When I was yours and you were blind 
The fire would sparkle in your eyes 
And mine 
So tell me you love me 
And if you don't then lie 
Lie to me 
Just tell me you love me 
If you don't then lie 
Lie to me 
If you don't then lie 
Lie to me 
And call it true 
Call it true love 
Call it true 
Call it true love
In the darkness before the dawn 
In the swirling of the storm 
When I'm rolling with the punches, and hope is gone 
Leave a light, a light on 
Millions of miles from home 
In the swirling, swimming on 
When I'm rolling with the thunder but bleed from thorns 
Leave a light, a light on 
Leave a light, a light on 
Leave a light, a light on 
Leave a light, a light on 
In the darkness before the dawn 
In the darkness before the dawn 
Leave a light, a light on 
Leave a light, a light on
Late night watching TV 
Used to be you here beside me 
Used to be your arms around me 
Your body on my body 
When the world means nothing to me 
Another's arms 
Another's arms 
When the pain just rips right through me 
Another's arms 
Another's arms 
Late night watching TV 
Used to be you here beside me 
Is there someone there to reach me? 
Or someone there to find me? 
When the pain just rips right through me 
Another's arms 
Another's arms 
And that's just torture to me 
Another's arms 
Another's arms 
Pull yourself into me 
Another's arms 
Another's arms 
When the world means nothing to me 
Another's arms 
Another's arms 
Got to pull you close into me 
Another's arms 
Another's arms 
Pull yourself right through me 
Another's arms 
Another's arms 
Late night watching TV 
Wish that you were here beside me 
Wish that your arms were around me 
Your body on my body
Wait for your call, love 
The call never came 
Ready to fall up 
Ready to claim 
And I'm ready for it all, love 
Ready for the pain 
Meet under sun and 
Meet me again 
In the rain 
In the rain 
Behind the walls, love 
I'm trying to change 
And I'm ready for it all, love 
I'm ready for the change 
Meet me in blue sky 
Meet me again 
In the rain 
In the rain 
In the rain 
You've got to find yourself alone in this world 
You've got to find yourself alone
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars 
I'm gonna give you my heart 
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars 
'Cause you light up the path 
I don't care, go on and tear me apart 
I don't care if you do, ooh 
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars 
I think I saw you 
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars 
I wanna die in your arms 
'Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark 
I'm gonna give you my heart 
I don't care, go on and tear me apart 
I don't care if you do, ooh 
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars 
I think I see you 
I think I see you 
'Cause you're a sky, you're a sky full of stars 
Such a heavenly view 
You're such a heavenly view
Flock of birds 
Hovering above 
Just a flock of birds 
It's how you think of love 
And I always 
Look up to the sky 
Pray before the dawn 
'Cause they fly always 
Sometimes they arrive 
Sometimes they are gone 
They fly on 
Flock of birds 
Hovering above 
Into smoke I'm turned 
And rise following them up 
Still I always 
Look up to the sky 
Pray before the dawn 
'Cause they fly away 
One minute they arrive, 
Next you know they're gone 
They fly on 
Fly on 
So fly on 
Ride through 
Maybe one day I'll fly next to you 
Fly on, ride through 
Maybe one day I can fly with you 
Fly on
On and on 
You're told which side you're on 
Ahh 
You're forced you're thrown 
To become the scythe to cut the corn 
Ahh 
And all your friends they ride into the sunset 
Fly into the sunset and away they go 
All your friends they ride into the sunset 
Fly into the sunset and away they're thrown 
Into the fire 
Ten below 
The call comes on the radio 
Ahh 
Over you go 
And the red now all the rivers flow, the poppies grow 
Ahh 
All your friends they ride into the sunset 
Fly into the sunset and away they blow 
And all your friends they ride into the sunset 
Ride into the sunset and they're taken home 
Open fire 
Open fire 
Open fire 
Open fire 
Open fire 
Just to ride and fire
Maybe I'm just a ghost 
Disappear when anybody's close 
Go through you when you travel 
Travel over near 
Maybe I'm just a ghost 
Emptied by 'em, anybody knows 
Maybe I'm on the ropes 
Or I'm not even here 
Yeaaah 
Every time I try to walk through walls 
More walls appear 
What's the point of feeling love for you 
When you don't believe I'm here? 
What's the point of trying to raise your voice 
If no one ever hears? 
Every time I try to pull you close 
You disappear 
Maybe I'm a ghost 
Just a whisper in a puff of smoke 
A secret that nobody knows 
No one will ever hear 
Or maybe I'm a ghost 
Specter on a wrong course 
Thorn without out a rose 
Something people fear 
Yeaaah 
And every time I thought I'll walk through walls 
It's all becoming clear 
What's the point in feeling love for you 
When you don't believe I'm here? 
What's the point of saying 'Rescue me! ' 
If no one ever hears? 
Every time I try to pull you close 
You disappear 
Every time I try to pull you close 
You disappear 
And every time I thought I'll walk through walls 
It's all becoming clear 
Every time I try to pull you close 
You disappear 
Every time I try to pull you close 
You disappe...!
Oh, I think I landed 
In a world I hadn't seen 
When I'm feeling ordinary 
When I don't know what I mean 
Oh, I think I landed 
Where there are miracles at work 
For the thirst and for the hunger 
Come the conference of birds 
Saying it's true 
It's not what it seems 
Leave your broken windows open 
And in the light just streams 
And you get a head 
A head full of dreams 
You can see the change you want to 
Be what you want to be 
When you get a head 
A head full of dreams 
Into life I just been spoken 
With a head full, a head full of dreams 
Oh, I think I landed 
Where there are miracles at work 
When you got me open handed 
When you got me lost for words 
I sing, oh-ohohoh 
Oh-ohohoh 
A head full of dreams 
A head full of dreams 
Into life I just been spoken 
With a head full, a head full of dreams
Been standing in the corner 
Studying the lights 
The dreaming of escape 
Will keep you up at night 
But someone had put the flare up 
Got me in rays 
So... I guess I better stay 
"Uh uh, no come on!" you say 
It's a fools gold thunder 
It's just warning rain 
Don't let the fears just start, what if 
I won't see you again 
Around here you never want to 
Sleep all night 
So start falling in love, 
Start the riot 
And come on rage with me 
We don't need words 
We'll be birds 
Got to make our own key 
Only got this moment 
You and me 
Guilty of nothing 
But geography 
Come on and raise it 
Come on raise this noise 
For the million people 
Who got not one voice 
Come on, it's not over! 
If you mean it say loud 
Come on, all for love 
Out from the underground 
Away with me 
We don't need words 
Close your eyes and see 
We'll be birds 
Flying free 
Holding on in the mystery 
Fearless through this you said 
We'll go 
Through this together (ooohh) 
When you fly won't you 
Won't you take me too? 
In this world so cruel 
I think you're so cool
Drink from me, drink from me 
Then we'll shoot across the sky 
Symphony 
Then we'll shoot across the sky 
We're on a... 
Drink from me, drink from me 
Then we'll shoot across the sky 
Symphony 
(So high, so high) 
Then we'll shoot across the sky 
Oh, angel sent from up above 
You know you make my world light up 
When I was down, when I was hurt 
You came to lift me up 
Life is a drink, and love's a drug 
Oh, now I think I must be miles up 
When I was a river, dried up 
You came to rain a flood 
And said drink from me, drink from me 
When I was so thirsty 
Pour on a symphony 
Now I just can't get enough 
Put your wings on me, wings on me 
When I was so heavy 
Pour on a symphony 
When I'm low, low, low, low 
I, oh, I, oh 
Got me feeling drunk and high 
So high, so high 
I, oh, I, oh, I, oh 
Now I'm feeling drunk and high 
So high, so high 
Woo! 
Oh, angel sent from up above 
I feel it coursing through my blood 
Life is a drink, your love's about 
To make the stars come out 
Put your wings on me, wings on me 
When I was so heavy 
Pour on a symphony 
When I'm low, low, low, low 
I, oh I, oh I 
Got me feeling drunk and high 
So high, so high 
Oh I, oh I, oh I 
I'm feeling drunk and high 
So high, so high 
I, oh I, oh I 
La la la la la la la 
So high, so high 
I, oh I, oh I 
I'm feeling drunk and high 
So high, so high 
Then we'll shoot across the sky 
Then we'll shoot across the... 
Then we'll shoot across the sky 
Then we'll shoot across the... 
Then we'll shoot across the sky 
Then we'll shoot across the... 
Then we'll shoot across the sky 
Then we'll shoot across the...
Oh they say people come 
They say people go 
This particular diamond was extra special 
And though you might be gone 
And the world may not know 
Still I see you celestial 
Like a lion you ran 
A goddess you rolled 
Like an eagle you circled 
In perfect purple 
So how come things move on 
How come cars don't slow 
When it feels like the end of my world? 
When I should but I can't let you go? 
But when I'm cold, cold 
When I'm cold, cold 
There's a light that you give me 
When I'm in shadow 
There's a feeling within me, an everglow 
Like brothers in blood 
Sisters who ride 
Yeah, we swore on that night 
We'd be friends 'til we died 
But the changing of winds 
And the way waters flow 
Life as short as the falling of snow 
And now I'm gonna miss you, I know 
But when I'm cold, cold 
In water rolled, salt 
And I know that you're with me 
And the way you will show 
And you're with me wherever I go 
'Cause you give me this feeling, this everglow 
What I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold 
Yeah, I live for this feeling, this everglow 
So if you love someone, you should let them know 
Oh, the light that you left me will everglow
Turn your magic on 
Umi she'd say 
Everything you want's a dream away 
And we are legends every day 
That's what she told me 
Turn your magic on, 
To me she'd say 
Everything you want's a dream away 
Under this pressure, under this weight 
We are diamonds 
Now I feel my heart beating 
I feel my heart underneath my skin 
And I feel my heart beating 
Oh, you make me feel 
Like I'm alive again 
Alive again 
Oh, you make me feel 
Like I'm alive again 
Said I can't go on, 
Not in this way 
I'm a dream that died by light of day 
Gonna hold up half the sky and say 
Only I own me 
And I feel my heart beating 
I feel my heart underneath my skin 
Oh, I can feel my heart beating 
'Cause you make me feel 
Like I'm alive again 
Alive again 
Oh, you make me feel 
Like I'm alive again 
Turn your magic on, 
Umi she'd say 
Everything you want's a dream away 
Under this pressure under this weight 
We are diamonds taking shape 
We are diamonds taking shape 
If we've only got this life 
This adventure, oh, then I 
And if we've only got this life 
You get me through 
And if we've only got this life 
In this adventure, oh, then I 
Want to share it with you 
With you 
With you 
Yeah I do 
Woohoo 
Woohoo 
Woohoo
I know it's over before she says 
I know it falls at the water face 
I know it's over, an ocean awaits 
For a storm 
The sun on snow, rivers in rain 
Crystal ball can foresee a change 
And I know it's over, a parting of ways 
And it's done 
But didn't we have fun? 
Don't say it was all a waste 
Didn't we have fun? 
From the top of the world 
Top of the waves 
We said forever, forever always 
We could have been lost 
We would have been saved 
Now we're stopping the world, stopping its spin 
Oh, come on don't give up 
Don't see me give in 
Don't say it's over 
Don't say we're done 
Oh, didn't we have fun? 
Oh, didn't we have fun? 
I know it's over before she says 
Know someone else has taken your place 
"I know it's over," Icarus says 
To the sun 
The sword sinks in, lightning strikes 
And two force, two forces collide 
And fight 'til it's over, 
Fight 'til it's done 
But didn't we have fun? 
Don't say it was all a waste 
Didn't we have fun? 
From the top of the world 
Top of the waves 
We said forever, forever always 
We could have been lost 
We would have been saved 
Now we're stopping the world, stopping in its tracks 
But nothing's too broken to find a way back 
Before it's over, before you run 
Ah, didn't we have fun? 
'Cause you and me 
We were always meant to... always meant to be 
We were always meant to... always meant to 
You and me 
We were always meant to... always meant to be 
Oh, didn't we have fun? 
Oh, didn't we have fun? 
But then... 
Maybe we could again
This being human is a guest house 
Every morning a new arrival 
A joy, a depression, a meanness 
Some momentary awareness comes 
As an unexpected visitor 
Welcome and entertain them all! 
Be grateful for whoever comes 
Because each has been sent as a guide
Been around the world, the wonders to view 
Been around the world, looking for someone like you 
Pyramids try, Babylon too 
But the beautifullest treasures lie in the deepest blue 
So I never say die, aim never untrue 
I'm never so high as when I'm with you 
And there isn't a fire, that I wouldn't walk through 
My army of one is gonna fight for you 
Been around the world, universe too 
Been around flying, baby, there's nothing I wouldn't do 
Tanzaku stars, Lasso the moon 
And be standing there beside you 
Right when the storm comes through 
'Cause I never say die, aim never untrue 
Never so high as when I'm with you 
And there isn't a fire, that I wouldn't walk through 
My army of one is gonna fight for you 
My army of one is gonna fight for you, yeah! 
'Cause you reign, all 'cause you reign 
All 'cause you reign 
My army of one is gonna call it through 
Sayin my heart is my gun, army of one 
Yeah my heart is my gun, army of one 
It's my only weapon, army of one 
Yeah my heart is my gun, army of one
(So I reach for it) 
Stare into darkness, staring at doom 
My heart go boom, bo-boom boom 
Stare into darkness, admit defeat 
Coming home and I'm finding no peace 
And I know, and I know and I know 
I know I'm out of luck 
And I know, and I know and I know 
I know what you've got 
I put my hands up to the sky, the feeling is like 
I've got a rocketship that I want to ride 
I put my hands up to the sky, the feeling is like 
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure 
(So I reach for it) Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure 
(So I reach for it) 
Stare into darkness, staring at doom 
You make my heart go boom, bo-boom boom 
Superhero, a masterpiece 
Been innocent but a sinner in me 
And I know, and I know and I know 
I know I'm in luck 
And I know, and I know and I know 
I know when I'm not 
I just put my hands up to the sky, I'm feeling like 
I've got a rocketship that I want to ride 
I put my hands up to the sky, the feeling is like 
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure 
I just put my hands up to the sky, the feeling is like 
I've got a rocket, eyes on the prize 
I put my hands up to the sky, I'm gonna find 
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure 
(So I reach for it) Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure 
(So I reach for it) Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure 
(So I reach for it) And I know, and I know, and I know 
(So I reach for it) I know what I've got 
X marks the spot 
I just put my hands up to the sky, I'm feeling like 
I've got a rocketship that I want to ride 
I put my hands up to the sky, the feeling is like 
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure 
We sat on a roof, named every star 
Shared every bruise and showed every scar 
Hope has its proof put your hand in mine, saying 
"Life has a beautiful, crazy design" 
And time seemed to say 
"Forget the world and it's weight" 
And here I just want to stay 
Amazing day 
Amazing day 
We sat on a roof, named every star  
You showed me a place 
Where you can be what you are 
And the view, the whole Milky Way 
In your eyes, I drifted away 
And in your arms I just want to sway 
Amazing day 
Amazing day 
Amazing day 
Amazing day 
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh 
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oooh 
And I asked  
Can the Birds in poetry, chime? 
Can there be breaks in the chaos sometimes? 
Oh, thanks God, must have heard when I prayed 
Cause now I always want to feel this way 
Amazing day 
Amazing day 
Amazing day 
Amazing day 
Yeah, today
Because each has been sent as a guide
Fixing up a car to drive in it again 
Searching for the water, hoping for the rain 
Up and up 
Up and up 
Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal 
Waiting for a chance to pick on your orange field 
Up and up 
Up and up 
See a pearl form a diamond in the rough 
See a bird soaring high above the flood 
It's in your blood 
It's in your blood 
Underneath the storm, an umbrella is saying, 
"Sitting with the poison takes away the pain." 
Up and up 
Up and up, saying 
We're gonna get it, get it together right now 
Gonna get it, get it together somehow 
Gonna get it, get it together and flower 
We're gonna get it, get it together, I know 
Gonna get it, get it together and flow 
Gonna get it, get it together and go 
Up and up and up 
Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon 
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon 
Up and up 
Up and up 
How come people suffer? How come people part? 
How come people struggle? How come people break your heart? 
Break your heart, oh 
Yes, I wanna grow, yes, I wanna feel 
Yes, I wanna know, show me how to heal it up 
Heal it up, oh 
Try and see the forest, there in every seed 
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed 
Just need love 
Just need love 
When the going is rough, saying 
We're gonna get it, get it together right now 
Gonna get it, get it together somehow 
Gonna get it, get it together and flower 
We're gonna get it, get it together, I know 
Gonna get it, get it together and flow 
Gonna get it, get it together and go 
But you can say what is, or fight for it 
Close your mind or take a risk 
You can say, "It's mine," and clench your fist 
Or see each sunrise as a gift 
We're gonna get it, get it together right now 
Gonna get it, get it together somehow 
Gonna get it, get it together and flower 
We're gonna get it, get it together, I know 
Gonna get it, get it together and flow 
Gonna get it, get it together and go 
Up and up and up 
Oh 
Fixing up a car to drive in it again 
When you're in pain, when you think you've had enough 
Don't ever give up 
Don't ever give up 
Believe in love
Stuck in a corner 
Are monkeys in cages 
That don't have a number 
To fight one another 
Try to recover 
Climb up the ladder 
Look up and you see birds 
Blind as each other 
How long can we suffer? 
We're as blind as each other 
On the cloud that you're sitting 
There's one born every minute 
So much to discover 
I've become a believer 
Sisters and brothers 
Who fight one another 
Will mourn and deceive us 
Will find us and keep us 
Take us or leave us 
How soon is now, yeah? 
How long is never? 
I'm nothing but normal 
With something together 
Come on and stick together 
On the cloud that you're sitting 
There's one born every minute 
So much to discover 
I've become a believer
My song is love 
My song is love, unknown 
And it goes up 
You don't have to be alone 
My heavy heart 
Looks like it's made of stone 
But it's so hard to see, clearly 
You don't have to be on your own 
You don't have to be on your own 
And I'm not gonna take it back 
Oh I'm not gonna say I don't mean that 
You're the target that I'm aiming at 
And I'm not singing on my own 
That bitter breathe 
That bitter breathe has blown 
Left me on fire, for you, clearly 
Taken everything and gone 
It’s taken everything I own 
But I'm not gonna take it back 
I’m not gonna say I don’t mean that 
You're the target that I'm aiming at 
And I'm nothing on my own 
Got to get that message home 
I'm not gonna stand and wait 
Not gonna leave it until it's much too late 
On a platform I'm gonna stand and say 
Oh I'm nothing on my own 
Till that bitter breathe has blown 
My song is love, Is love uknown 
And I’ve got to get that message home
As far as I can see 
All time and circuitry  
Is wrong 
As far as poetry 
Sit down and sing to me 
A song 
'Cause all I want in this world 
All I want in this world 
Is for you to come home 
A spell a rebel yell 
A spell 
Soldier come home to me 
You've been away from me 
So long 
All I want in this world 
All I want and deserve 
Is for you to come home 
A spell a rebel yell
Animals we are 
Disposable, collapsible and raw 
In you go into some crowded room 
And animals that climb 
And they're climbing over you until you say 
"Off you go, off you go" 
Animal I am 
And I'm looking for an answer just like you 
But I should know which way to turn 
An animal that runs 
And I ran away from you because I'm scared 
"Now off you go, off you go" 
If you're gonna go, go now  
If you're gonna go, go now  
I forgot to tell you how  
So if you're gonna go 
Go now  
Animal you are 
Disposable defenceless yes and 
Watch your mouth, boys watch your mouth  
An animal that runs 
And I made all my excuses to you  
And I missed my chance by a stones throw 
If you're gonna go, go now  
If you're gonna go, go now  
I forgot to tell you how 
So if you're gonna go 
Go now 
Go now 
Go now 
Go now 
And I crumble 
Crumble and fall 
Crumble and fall like an animal 
I crumble 
Crumble and fall 
Crumble and fall like an animal 
Yes I crumble 
Crumble and fall 
Crumble and fall like an animal 
Yes I crumble 
Crumble and fall 
Crumble and fall like an animal
Some saw the sun 
Some saw the smoke 
Some heard the gun 
Some bent the bow 
Sometimes the wire must tense for the note 
Caught in the fire, say oh 
We're about to explode 
Carry your world, I'll carry your world 
Carry your world, I'll carry your world 
Some far away 
Some search for gold 
Some dragon to slay 
Heaven we hope is just up the road 
Show me the way, lord, 'cause I... I'm about to explode 
Carry your world, I'll carry your world 
Carry your world, I'll carry your world 
Carry your world, and all your hurt. 
(Carry your world, carry your world)
Bones are sinking like stones  
All that we fall for 
Homes places we've grown 
All of us are done for 
And we live in a beautiful world (yeah we do yeah we do) 
We live in a beautiful world 
Bones sinking like stones 
All that we've fall for 
homes places we've grown  
All of us are done for 
And we live in a beautiful world (yeah we do yeah we do) 
We live in a beautiful world
We live in a beautiful world
Oh all that I know is nothing to run from 
Cause yeah everybody here got's somebody to lean on
People wanna fight for fun 
But what is a battle when the war's already been won 
People wanna break what's built 
There's no use crying when the milk's already been spilt 
Here's a needle, here's a thread 
Sew yourself up, clear your head 
Here's a needle, here's a thread 
Oh no, I meant exactly what I said 
You might find that you're useless 
No better than a hole in the ground 
You might find that you're useless 
No better than a hole in the ground 
Look at all the cavemen goin' 
Turning over to the shore 
I'm only looking for a bloodless revolution 
I'm only looking for a bloodless revolution 
I'm only looking for a bloodless revolution
Brothers and sisters unite 
It's the time of your lives its the time of your lives 
Break down, break down 
Got to spread love around, got to spread it around 
Brothers and sisters feel fine 
It's the time of your lives, it's the time of your lives 
There's no sound, no sound 
Like this feeling you found like this feeling you found 
But just stay down 
Cause sometimes you feel 
So stay down 
And sometimes you feel 
And it's me they're lookin' for 
And it's me, I will never survive 
But we'll be around some more 
Brothers and sisters unite 
It's the time of your lives, it's the time of your lives 
Breakdown, breakdown 
Got to spread love around, got to spread it all around 
But just stay down 
And sometimes you feel 
So stay around 
And sometimes you'll feel 
And it's me they're looking for 
And it's me, I will never survive 
But well be around some more 
It's gonna be alright 
It's gonna be alright  
It's gonna be alright
When you're sitting on a beach in a car with the paint dried up 
Well, you're gonna give a cause when the rain washed up 
Well being just there with the gypsy talking to my friend 
But you'll never get with it if you don't get respect 
Oh well you'll never get with it if you just want respect 
But sometimes the money's gonna run out 
And you'll be standing on the corner with a belly full of doubt 
Sometimes somebodys gonna bring you down 
And you'll be standing on your own with a bucket for a crown 
Well me and the boys were standing thinking we were hip 
I don't wanna be the captain of a sinking ship 
Well me and the boys in a town where the mormon go 
Listening to a session by noel Gallagher 
I was listening to a session by noel Gallagher 
They said sometimes your money's gonna run out 
And you'll be standing on a corner with a belly full of doubt 
Oh someday somebody's gonna bring you down 
And you'll be standing on a corner with a bucket for a crown 
Oh you'll be standing on a corner,  just waiting on a corner 
Standing on a corner with a bucket for a crown
I feel safe 
I feel warm 
When you're here, can I do no wrong? 
I am cured, when I'm by you're side 
I'm alright, yes I'm alright 
I'm safe when I am with you 
And I feel warm if you want me to 
I am cured, when I'm by your side 
I'm alright 
Careful where you stand, my love 
Careful where you lay your head 
It's true we're always there 
Looking out for one another 
I feel safe when I'm with you 
And I feel warm if you want me to 
I am cured when you're all alone 
I'm alright 
So I'd like a quiet town, please 
I'd like a quiet town 
Oh now now 
Oh now now 
And careful where you stand 
And careful where you stand
Christmas night, 
Another fight, 
Tears we cried, 
A flood 
Got all kinds of poison in, of poison in my blood 
I took my feet 
To Oxford Street, 
Trying to right a wrong 
"Just walk away," those windows say, but I can't believe she's gone. 
When you're still waiting for the snow to fall 
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all 
Up above candles on air flicker 
Oh they flicker and they flow 
And I am up here holding on to all those chandeliers of hope 
And like some drunken Elvis singing 
I go singing out of tune 
Singing how I've always loved you, darling, and I always will 
Oh when you're still waiting for the snow to fall 
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all 
Still waiting for the snow to fall 
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all 
Those Christmas lights light up the street 
Down where the sea and city meet 
May all your troubles soon be gone 
Oh Christmas lights, keep shining on 
Those Christmas lights light up the street 
Maybe they'll bring her back to me 
Then all my troubles will be gone 
Oh Christmas lights, keep shining on 
Oowwwhhhohooooowohohohoooo 
Oh Christmas lights light up the street 
Light up the fireworks in me 
May all your troubles soon be gone 
Those Christmas lights keep shining on
It could be worse 
I could be alone 
I could be locked in here on my own 
Or like a stone that suddenly drops 
It never stops, no 
I could be lost 
Or I could be saved 
Calling out from beneath the waves 
Beaten down by this ocean rain 
Never again 
Never again 
Screaming out from the crests of waves 
It could be worse 
Bitter or sweet 
It could be snapped from the jaws of defeat 
Or like a light lit up on a beach  
Wear your heart on your sleeve 
Oh 
You want to stop before you begin 
You want to sink when you know you could swim 
You want to stop just before you begin 
Never give in 
Never give in 
Screaming out from the crests of waves 
Nothing matters 
Except life and the love you make 
Nothing matters 
Except life and the love you make 
Nothing matters 
Except life and the love you make 
Except life and the love you make 
Screaming out from the crests of waves 
Screaming out from the crests of waves 
You're longing to be saved 
Screaming out from the crests of waves 
You are longing to be saved 
Screaming out from the crests of waves
If sweet death should ever come for me 
Let me know, boys, let me know 
If you hear him coming, won't you let me flee 
Let me go, boys, let me go 
One day death is gonna conquer me 
I'll be down where the water flows 
I hope sweet heaven is the place for me 
Let me know, boys, let me know 
If sweet death should ever come for me 
Take me down to some place below 
If you hear him coming, won't you set me free 
Let me go boys, let me go 
If you hear him comin', won't you say for me 
That I just don't want to go
Oooh 
Oooh oooh 
Oooh 
So we left La Mancha 
Heading out for higher plains 
Me and Sancho Panza 
Looking for adventure 
Rocinante at the reigns 
'Till the windmills answer 
You'll never be lonely 
You'll never be lonely ever again 
You'll never be lonely 
You'll never be lonely again 
I heard you never get wet in Spanish rain 
So they sent the doctor 
For examining my brain 
Said he's not too clever 
When the world, when the world just seems 
A little bit too cruel 
Gonna leave it better 
Gonna make one better, yeah! 
So tell that princess 
Tell that princess "hide down the drain" 
Tell that princess she'll never be lonely again 
I heard you never get wet in Spanish rain 
Oooh 
Oooh 
I heard you never get wet in Spanish rain 
Where the people sing 
"Ole ole ole ole 
Ole ole..." 
( [The People:]  Ole ole ole ole, Coldplay Coldplay...) 
I heard you never get wet in Spanish rain 
I heard you never get wet in Spanish rain
Love, I hope we get on  
I hope we can find a way  
Seeing it all  
Love, I hope we can be  
I hope I can find a way  
Of letting you see  
That I'm so easy to please  
So easy  
Love, I hope we grow up  
I hope we can find a way  
Of seeing it all  
Love, I hope we can be  
I hope I can find a way  
Of letting you see  
That I'm so easy to please  
So easy
If you're lost and feel alone 
Circumnavigate the globe 
All you ever have to hope for two 
And the way you seem to float 
Circumnavigate in hope 
And they seem to lose control 
With you 
Ooh... 
Everyone of us is hurt 
And everyone of us is scarred 
Everyone of us is scared 
Not you 
Your eyes closed  
Your head hurts 
Your eyes feel so low 
Ooh... 
Everyone of us is scared 
Everyone of us is hurt 
Everyone of us has hope 
For you  
For you  
For you  
For you  
For you  
For you  
For you  
For you  
For you  
For you
Baby 
It's been a long time coming 
Such a long, long time 
And I can't stop running 
Such a long, long time 
Can you hear my heart beating? 
Can you hear that sound? 
'Cause I can't help thinking 
And I won't stop now 
And then I looked up at the sun 
And I could see 
Oh, the way that gravity pulls on you and me 
And then I looked up at the sky 
And saw the sun 
And the way that gravity pushes on everyone 
On everyone 
Baby 
When your wheels stop turning 
And you feel let down 
And it seems like troubles 
Have come all around 
I can hear your heart beating 
I can hear that sound 
But I can't help thinking 
And I won't look now 
And then I looked up at the sun 
And I could see 
Oh, the way that gravity pulls on you and me 
And then I looked up at the sky 
And saw the sun 
And the way that gravity pushes on everyone 
On everyone 
On everyone 
On everyone 
On everyone 
On everyone
They put the world in a tin can black market, contraband 
And it hurt just a little bit, when they sliced and packaged it 
In a long black trench coat two hands around the throat 
Oh, you want to get it right sometimes 
There's so much to be scared of and not much to make sense of 
How did the clowns ever get control? If your hear can you let me know 
How can they invade it, when it's so complicated? 
Oh, you just want to get it right sometimes 
You just want to get it right sometimes 
That's how you see the world 
How many times can you say, you can't believe what you learn 
That's how you see the world, don't you worry yourself 
You're not gonna give up, ooh 
And there's something missing, seems like there's nobody listening 
If you're running in a circle, how can you be too careful? 
We don't wanna be man trapped, we don't wanna be shrink wrapped 
Oh, we just want to get it right sometimes 
We just want to get it right sometimes 
That's how you see the world 
How many times have you heard, but you can't believe a word 
That's how you see the world, but don't you worry yourself 
'Cause nobody can hurt you, ooh, ooh, oh 
That's how you see the world 
That's how you see the world
Darling, those tired eyes 
Go with me all the time 
And in the dead of night 
Tell me you will be mine 
Where do you go to, pretty babe? 
Where do you go to when the night winds away? 
Ask me so sweetly, what do I do? 
And who do I sing for 
Well honey I sing about you 
You
I ran away from you 
That's all I ever do 
And though I started here 
I ran away from you 
I'm gonna come on in 
And see it through 
I ran away from you 
That's all I ever do 
And when I heard you call to 
Come back to me 
And though I should stay 
I don't have the stomach to 
Everyone I know 
Says I'm a fool to mess with you 
Everyone I know 
Says it's a stupid thing to do 
I have your love on call 
And yet my day is not so full 
There might be nothing left to do 
So I ran away from you 
I'm gonna come on in 
My eyes are closed 
I can feel it there 
The sun's so close 
I'm gonna come on out 
And burn the sky 
A star arose in my own cage 
I'm stuck in line 
And in a cage 
Just a single star 
I sing for 
Everyone I know 
Says I'm a fool to mess with you 
Everyone I know 
Says it's a stupid thing to do 
I have your love on call 
And yet my day is not so full 
And I did not know what to do 
And so I ran away from you
From up above I heard  
The angels sing to me these words. 
And sometimes in your eyes  
I see the beauty in the world. 
Oh, now I'm floating so high. 
I blossom and die. 
Send your storm and your lightning to strike  
Me between the eyes, 
Eyes 
Sometimes the stars decide  
To reflect in puddles in the dirt. 
When I look in your eyes  
I forget all about what hurts. 
Oh, now I'm floating so high. 
I blossom and die. 
Send your storm and your lightning to strike  
Me between the eyes 
And cry. 
Believe in miracles. 
Oh hey, I'm floating up above the world now! 
Oh hey, I'm floating up above the world now! 
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah!
Come on now, don't you want to see 
This thing that's happening to me 
Like Moses had power over sea 
So you've got power over me 
Come on now, don't you want to know 
Cause you're a refuge, somewhere I can go 
And you're air that, air that I can breathe 
You're my golden opportunity 
And oh, oh yes I would 
If I only could 
And you know I would 
And baby I, oh baby I 
Come on now, don't you want to see 
Just what a difference you've made to me 
And I'll be waiting no matter what you say 
And I'll keep waiting for days and days and days 
And oh, oh yes I would 
If I only could 
And you know I would 
And baby I, oh baby I 
I wish 
Oh, oh, oh 
Oh, oh, oh 
If the sky's gonna fall down let it fall on me 
If you're gonna break down you can break on me 
If the sky's gonna fall down let it fall on me 
Oh, let it fall on me
Somewhere up above the stars 
The wreckage of a universe floats past 
Somewhere up above my heart 
A tiny little seed is sown, a government is overthrown, 
Who knows when we'll be coming home at last 
And I heard it on the radio that one day we'll be living in the stars 
And I heard it on a TV show that somewhere up above and in my heart 
They'll be tearing us apart, maybe moving us to Mars 
We won't see the earth again 
And the seconds just remain unchanged 
8 to 9, 9 to 10 
We are meeting for the first time 
We might never meet again, you and me 
We are meeting for the first time can't you see 
7 6 5 4 3 
We are meeting for the first time 
Singing this space symphony 
They'll be tearing us apart, maybe moving us to Mars, 
Past the satellites and stars, they're moving us to Mars
Murder coming to get us 
Yeah coming to get us and away we hide 
Murder, see it all around us 
See it all around us 
And away we hide 
Murder coming to get us 
They're coming to get us 
And away we hide 
Away we hide 
Tie me to a tree 
Tie my hands above my head  
Sing a song to me  
Sing a song like what you said  
And they're gonna murder me  
They're gonna take me down  
Even before I sleep 
I cry murder 
Come spit at us  
Come and throw your weight around  
Come and fight with us  
Try and knock us to the ground  
'Cause they're gonna murder me  
They're gonna take me down  
Even before I sleep 
I scream murder 
Murder 
Oh now what can it possibly gain?  
Oh what can it possibly gain?  
Oh now what can it possibly gain? 
Oh yeah what can it possibly gain? 
Cry murder, murder 
I cry murder 
Murder I'm coming to get us 
I'm coming to get us 
And away we hide 
Murder, see it all around us 
See it all around us 
And away we hide 
Murder coming to get us 
It's coming to get us  
And away we hide 
Murder, see it all around you 
See it all around you 
And away we hide
Sometimes I wake up, and I'm falling asleep,  
And I think that maybe the curtains are closing on me,  
But I wake up,  
Yes I wake up,  
Smiling.  
Sometimes I feel that the chance is surprising,  
Surprisingly good to be moving around,  
So I wake up,  
Yes I wake up,  
Smiling 
So what? I feel fine,  
I'm OK, I've seen the lighter side of life,  
I'm alright, I feel good,  
So I'll do, I'll try to stop moving,  
Sometimes I wake up, and I'm falling asleep,  
And I've got to get going so much that I wanted to do,  
Yes I wake up,  
Smiling.  
And this could be my last chance,  
This may be my only chance,  
Yeah this could be my last chance,  
No more keeping my feet on the ground.  
Sometimes I feel that the chance is surprising,  
Surprisingly good to be moving around,  
And I move,  
And I wake up,  
Smiling  
So what? I feel fine,  
I'm OK, I've seen the lighter side of life,  
I'm alright, I feel good,  
So I'll do, well it's time to stop moving.  
And this could be my last chance, 
This may be my only chance,  
Yeah this could be my last chance,  
No more keeping my feet on the ground.  
There's nothing to keep me,  
Nothing to keep me 
Back
Here's an Ode, ah, to deodorant 
It's my thing, ah it's my favourite hygiene 
It keeps me through the day 
Another ode, ah to deodorant 
It's my thing, ah it's my favourite hygiene 
It's the confidence I need 
It's medicine for the soul 
It's medicine for the mind 
It picks me up and makes me whole 
It makes me feel alright 
Here's an Ode, an ode to aerosol 
It's my thing 
Ah, it's my favourite hygiene, it's the confidence I need 
It's medicine for the soul 
It's medicine for the mind 
It picks me up and makes me whole 
It makes me feel alright 
It's okay Oh, would I ever let you down? No way 
Oh, would I ever let you down, okay? 
Oh, would I ever let you down, no way 
Oh, would I ever let you down... 
I'll never let ya, I'll never let ya, I'll never let you down, no way 
Would I ever let you let you down, no way 
Would I ever let you let you down, no way 
Would I ever let you let you down, no way 
Would I ever let you let you down, no way
Could you, could you come back 
Come back together 
Put yourself on the band 
And see us forever  
Could you, could you come home 
Come home forever 
Surely things in the band 
Keep us together  
Cause you're the one I love 
You're the one I love 
You're the one I love 
Ahhhh, ahhhh 
Could you, could you come home 
Could you tell me whatever 
Tie youself to a mast 
It's now or it's never 
Could it tear us apart 
It'll soon be forever 
It's gonna tear us apart  
Keep us together 
You're the one I love 
You're the one I love 
Ahhh ahhh 
You're the one I love 
Yeah yeah you're the one 
Oooooo... 
Oooooo... 
You're the one I love 
You're the one I love 
You're the one I love
The cardboard head I see 
Has found its way to me 
Its out and its out and its out 
Making me cry 
I sleep but I will not move 
I'm too scared to leave my room 
But I won't be defeated, oh no 
What if cars don't go my way 
And its sure to spoil my day? 
But in voices loud and clear you say to me; 
"Its only superstition 
Its only your imagination 
Its only all the things that you fear 
And the things from which you can't escape" 
Keep clean for the thousandth time 
Stand still and wait in line 
Some numbers are better than others 
Oh no 
And its making me cry, and its making me cry 
And I'm slipping away, I'm slipping away 
Its only superstition, only your imagination 
And its only superstition, only superstition.
Poor me, I'm floating out to sea  
An opportunity that went by  
Poor you, oh what you gonna do  
No what you gonna do, you just cry  
Oh, you always come undone  
Try into the sun, you don't know why  
Poor you, I know what you gonna do  
Come on love I'll see it through, I don't know why  
I hear you come nearer  
I hear you but I don't understand  
I hear you come nearer  
I hear you but I don't understand  
Poor me, now float me out to sea  
Oh no just let it be, come on try  
Poor you, oh what you gonna do  
Oh what you gonna do, you just cry  
I hear you come nearer  
I hear you but I don't understand  
I hear you come nearer  
I hear you but I don't understand  
I don't understand  
I don't understand  
Oooh, ahhhh, ahhhh
Whoa, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Whoa, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Once upon a time, somebody ran, 
Somebody ran away saying "Fast as I can, 
I got to go, I got to go" 
Once upon a time, we fell apart, 
You're holding in your hands the two halves of my heart, 
Oh whoa, oh whoa 
Could've been a princess, you'd be a king, 
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring 
But no, you let me go, 
Could've been a princess, you'd be a king, 
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring 
But no, you let me go, 
You stole my star, 
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la 
You stole my star 
La la la la la la 
Whoa, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
Once upon a time, we were burning bright, 
Now all we ever seem to do is fight, 
On and on, and on and on and on 
Once upon a time, on the same side, 
Once upon a time, on the same side, 
In the same game 
And why'd you have to go? 
Have to go and throw water on my flame? 
Could've been a princess, you'd be a king, 
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring 
But no, you let me go, 
Could've been a princess, you'd be a king, 
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring 
But no, you let me go, 
You stole my star, 
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la 
You stole my star 
La la la la la la 
Whoa, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
'Cause you really hurt me 
No, you really hurt me, 
'Cause you really hurt me 
No, you really hurt me, 
'Cause you really hurt me, oh 
You really hurt me, oh 
'Cause you really hurt me, oh 
You really hurt me
So I waited for you 
What wouldn't I do? 
And I'm covered, it's true 
I'm covered in you 
If I ever want proof 
I find it in you 
Yeah I honestly do 
In you I find proof 
Light and dark 
A bright spark 
Light and dark 
And then, light 
So I waited all day 
What wouldn't I say? 
And are there things in your way? 
Things happen that way 
Oh 
And if I ever want proof 
Then I find it in you 
Oh 
Yeah I honestly do 
In you I find proof 
Light and dark 
A bright spark 
Light and dark 
And then, light 
Light 
Light 
Light 
Light
Climb up your mountain 
Nineteen and countin' 
You have got seven, I have got one 
Blinded and hurtin' 
This I'm deserving 
I've got my secrets 
You've only got the sleeping sun 
When you've got a secret 
Then you've got to keep it 
When you've got a question 
Answers will come 
Running and hiding 
Take and dividing 
You've got your secrets 
I've only got a sleeping sun 
Sleeping sun 
Singing 
Oooh um 
Ohhhh oh... 
Ahhh ahh 
Oh oh 
Oh oh 
Oh ohh 
And you, as I, saw 
A piece in a jigsaw 
Run up and around it and 
Jump up real tall 
Run round the houses 
North and the souths' 
You've got your answers we've 
Only got a sleeping sun 
Sleeping sun 
Singing 
Oooh um 
Ohhhh oh... 
Ahhh ahh 
Oh oh 
Oh oh 
Oh ohh
I went digging for gold 
I went down to the valley 
Over by the mountain 
Where the prospektor had been told 
I'm marching through the cold 
We're marching through the cold 
I went digging for gold 
I went down with my brother 
A bucket and a shovel 
and a book about the colour of coal 
I'm marching through the cold 
We're marching through the cold 
There's a tiny little crackle on the telephone line 
Saying what use the metal if the metal don't shine? 
She said bring me back a ring cause I really want one 
Now I been digging so long that I never seen the sun 
I went digging for gold 
I went down to the valley 
Over by the mountain 
Where the prospektor had been told 
I'm marching through the cold 
We're marching through the cold 
There's a tiny little crackle on the telephone line 
Saying what use the metal if the metal don't shine? 
She said bring me back a ring cause I really want one 
Now I been digging so long that I never seen the sun 
Now I been digging so long that I never seen the sun 
again..one last time 
Now I been digging so long that I never seen the sun
X and Y 
The land, sea, rivers, trees, the stars, the sky 
That and this 
We're part of a bigger plan 
Don't know what it is 
Don't know what it is 
You and me 
The land, sun, trees, the sky, the stars, the sea 
365 degrees 
I am a puzzle, you're the missing piece 
Hang on a minute, just a minute, please 
I'll come 
And everything under the sun 
And everything under the sun 
What is this feeling that I can't explain? 
And why am I never gonna sleep again? 
What is this thing I've never seen before? 
A little boy lost in a breaking storm 
Hide and sob, and away they fly 
To write your name in the summer sky 
Life has really only just begun 
Life that comes 
And everything under the sun 
X is Y 
The land, sea, rivers, trees, the stars, the sky 
365 degrees 
All of the surface and the underneath 
Searching your mellow and outsings your key, ah 
And everything under the sun 
And everything under the sun 
What is this feeling that I can't explain? 
And why am I never gonna sleep again? 
What is this thing I've never seen before? 
A little boy lost in a breaking storm 
Hide and sob, and away they fly 
To write your name in the summer sky 
Life has really only just begun 
Life that comes 
And everything under the sun 
And you don't know that you've been born 
Can't see the calm until the storm 
Can't tell your right side from your wrong 
Can't see the wave you're riding on
How tides control the sea  
And what becomes of me  
How little things can slip out of your hand  
How often people change  
No two remain the same  
Why things don't always turn out as you planned  
These are things that I don't understand  
Yeah these are things that I don't understand  
I can't (and I can't)  
Decide  
Wrong (oh my wrong)  
From right  
Day (oh my day)  
From night  
Dark (oh my dark)  
From light  
I love (but I love)  
This life  
How infinite is space  
And who decides your fate  
Why everything will dissolve into sand  
How to avoid defeat  
Where truth and fiction meet  
Why nothing ever turns out as you planned  
These are things that I don't understand  
Yeah these are things that I don't understand  
I can't (and I can't)  
Decide  
Wrong (oh my wrong)  
From right  
Day (oh my day)  
From night  
Dark (oh my dark)  
From light  
I love (but I love)  
This life.
It's been a night 
Such a night 
Such a long night 
Watch myself disappear 
Into the wild side 
Said good bye to hard side 
Sang, saw a jackal appear 
Every road, that's wrong 
Seems like the road, I'm on 
Every sign just seems unclear 
Won't you come switch me on 
Don't know where I've gone 
And I, I wish I was here 
In a fight, such a fight 
You love our fight 
I'm not lying, this I swear 
(The demons that hide inside 
To the wild, why am I tired 
How come I'm never there) 
Every road, that's wrong 
Seems like the road, I'm on 
Every sign just seems unclear 
Won't you come switch me on 
Don't know where I've gone 
And I, I wish I was here 
And I, I wish I was here 
And I, I wish I was here
I slipped away last night 
Took me away from sight and the place I know 
All crushed upon my skin 
This mess I put you in and the punch I thrown 
It was a strange reaction 
For someone like you to remain on side 
And in a chain reaction 
I was down and calling for a place to hide 
I saw a broken arm 
Machines will all break down in the way I know 
Mended and all made clean 
I saw up on the screen all the stones I throw 
It was a strange reaction 
For someone like you to remain so sure 
And in a chain reaction 
I dissolve and break and then away I crawl
